yes, open gmsh, choose file->merge then click the first/last image, hold shift and click the last/first image. (i don't remember one order may make it backwards)

        1) Open gmsh and MERGE all the images you want
        2) Open anim_mod.script - it will flash through all images and save a pile
        of .gif images
        3) Open a video editor such as Windows Movie Maker and import all the
        images and make a movie out of them

        -I don't actually know if these other .scripts are used but they are
        probably here for some reason.
